# Install libraries to interact with the BME680 sensor

## Bosh BSCE setup

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/alexh-name/bsec_bme680_linux.git`. This is a great repo that includes C code to call Bosh's libraries. These are close source and include code to calculate an IAQ score (Interior Air Quality) that depends on other atmospheric factors. Unfortunatelly not public how this calculation is done. I'll be changing some of the code of this repo to upload readings to Azure.
